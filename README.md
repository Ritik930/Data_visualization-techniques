# Lung Cancer Data Visualization

This repository demonstrates various visualization techniques to analyze and interpret a lung cancer dataset. The project utilizes Python libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly to create insightful visualizations, providing a better understanding of the data.

## Dataset

The dataset, `survey lung cancer.csv`, contains information about patients, including factors like age, smoking habits, and lung cancer status.

### Key Columns in the Dataset:
- **AGE**: The age of the patients.
- **SMOKING**: A numerical value indicating the smoking level.
- **LUNG_CANCER**: Indicates if the patient has lung cancer (`YES` or `NO`).

## Features

The project includes the following visualizations:
1. **Line Chart**: Displays the relationship between age and lung cancer occurrences.
2. **Scatter Plot**: Shows the distribution of smoking levels against age, with lung cancer status as a hue.
3. **Heatmap**: Highlights correlations between numerical variables in the dataset.
4. **3D Scatter Plot**: Visualizes the interaction between age, smoking, and lung cancer status in three dimensions.

## How to Run

### Prerequisites:
- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab
- Required libraries: `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `plotly`, `pandas`, `numpy`

### Steps:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Lung-Cancer-Data-Visualization.git
2. Open the visualization.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
3. Upload the dataset (survey lung cancer.csv) if not already present.
4. Run the cells sequentially to generate the visualizations.
